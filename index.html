            <p class="text-left mb-5 pb-4">I’ve been building and developing the future in one place my entire UX career. From day one, I’ve poured my heart, soul, and a ton of wireframes into making things better, always striving to push the boundaries of what’s possible. It’s been a journey of growth, challenges, and more “Aha!” moments than I can count, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything. <br>When the Design and Product teams were freshly hatched, I had the honor (and a bit of chaos) of being the first designer on board. Think of me as the first squirrel to venture out onto a busy road—I took the leap and grew the design process and built the design system, component library, and UX Research process from scratch!
                While I truly appreciated the feedback and insights from my Product team, Engineers, and Stakeholders, the responsibility of creating a UX-focused atmosphere was all part of my job description. It was a wild ride that sharpened my design skills and solidified my passion for crafting user-centric solutions.</p>

Leveraging the existing UI design from other new features, we decided to keep things straightforward.

The updated navigation system significantly simplified application navigation, but the classic components—still the most used parts of our application—lacked approval for updates to align with the new UI standards. Concerns like 'it works fine' and 'it's not a high priority' were often cited.<br/><br/>As the lead of UX, I advocated for a unified navigation system because I recognized that launching new features without a cohesive way to navigate the application would lead to user frustration. I collected data from clients and consulted UX best practices, but unfortunately, my proposal was denied in order to meet deadlines.<br/><br/>Coming from a front-end development background, I approached my boss with a proposal to take on this feature myself. In my own free time, I developed the unified navigation because I believed so strongly in its necessity. I was more than willing to see it through to completion.">

The need for extensive training has been eliminated, empowering users at an Excel level to create complex forms just as effectively as their IT counterparts could with the old system.<br/><br/>This project has been my passion from day one.

It can feel pretty daunting to pass off a project you've poured your heart into, especially when the developers are racing against tight deadlines. After trying a few different approaches, I found that building a custom component library specifically for the handoff process was a game-changer. It not only helped communicate design expectations and inspiration but also clarified the basic styling information that developers needed to bring the vision to life. </br></br>

                        I created a system with pointers, large and small annotations, status symbols, timelines for changes, and even threw in some fun stickers. This setup helped me track what's ready, what's in progress, and what’s still in the 'nice-to-have' dream phase. For developers, it made it easy to find the right links, grab the CSS they needed, check the status of various elements, and spot any recent updates right away.</br></br>
                        
                        By organizing the Figma files with section colors and detailed, pinpointed notes, I made sure developers knew exactly where to find everything. It gave them the confidence that what they were working with was a 'ready to go' mockup, no second-guessing needed. The whole process smoothed the transition from design to development and ensured everyone stayed on the same page.">
